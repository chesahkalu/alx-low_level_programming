# C - Preprocessor :page_with_curl:0x0D-preprocessor 

## About this project:
   In this project i learne and practiced:
   - macros and how to use them
   - the most common predefined macros
   - How to include guard your header files


## Tasks File Description:

  * [0-object_like_macro.h](./0-object_like_macro.h): Header file that defines a
  macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

  * [1-pi.h](./1-pi.h): Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation
  for the token `3.14159265359`.

  * [2-main.c](./2-main.c): C program that prints the name of the file it was
  compiled from followed by a new line.

  * [3-function_like_macro.h](./3-function_like_macro.h): Header file that defines a
  function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

  * [4-sum.h](./4-sum.h): Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)`
  that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
